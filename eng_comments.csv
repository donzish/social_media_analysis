What i actually would like to do is: use my psych background to gather insights based upon already proven scientific concepts, but im a bit afraid that as a data analyst actually i would maybe even work below some mba or psychogy-person who then just gives me the task while all my conceptual knowledge in the field wouldnt count much and i maybe would even earn less?

Happy New Year!
Thank you for this awesome tutorial! I'm currently learning Tableau and your videos have been ugely helpfull! but i still have some issues with dashboard creation.
Maybe can you (or some of your viewers) help me as a Tableau Power User? 

I want to create a ""filter like"" menu for 5 diff√©rents sheets, if user click on the first option i want the sheet X to be visible, if user click the second option, i want to replace the sheet X by the sheet Y...
I also want to create some condition on a filter ""if filter has selected a single value, show sheet Z, else show sheet W""

I think all of this can happen in Tableau, but i don't know ""how to make it happen""...

362,"I've been programming since I was 13 and honestly computation is totally language independent even though there's always  different Paradigm shifts that are always evolving since the days of Fortran.
         The truth of the matter is just because there's different libraries and packages that are already written and all you have to do is just pretend to be a hacker and jump into those libraries and packages and develop some code that is not even likely understood because it hasn't really been thought out yet or planned it's just sort of Cobble together.
            The truth is the same results can be obtained using Microsoft quick basic so the language platform that the computation is actually performed in & Computation on is actually irrelevant just like anyone could write a thesis using notepad and nobody really needs to use Microsoft Word or Google Docs...
            Python will come and go and something else will replace Python and all of its little funny libraries

it is a lot of work. but its still hella good. 

its not nearly as much work as my BA from a top school... but its like maybe one quarter of hard work. I mean, there is so much to understand, so dont rush it. take your time. if you get the cert, but dont have the skills, it does even make sense.

To put it this way major companies are not going to be in the habit of changing the program they made every year to fit the new Linux or Mac OS nor are they doing to put the money to make it compatibility with the way both use hardware or more like there of not having old programs run on new hardware well. 

Example.: The fact that I can run Diablo 1 or even Doom from 95 on a PC with brand new hardware with very few to no problems says a lot. The fact that I can run XP, Vista, 7, and 8 on new hardware also says a lot. That fact that Windows takes time to end support also says a lot. In other words yes Windows 11 came out do you need to upgrade? No you have until 2025 and even then you will have major companies that have there own fire walls and so on in which they won't even upgrade to Winndows 11.

503,"Hi Luke. I am a recent subscriber. I would like to ask your opinion on some path choices. My field is environmental engineering and I am interested in learning data analysis in order to build my CV,  maybe land a job in research and get accepted into a Masters for uni. I need data analysis for working with large data structures for projects and studies. I realized, writing my thesis, that, if I knew Python, I would easily be able to work with my dataset, and would save weeks off my project. So, now, I started with ""Python for Everybody"" in Coursera, which teaches you Python to work with data structures, etc. I plan to go for the Google certificate after this. My plan is to finish them both in the next 9 months. In short, I don't need the data analysis certificate as a main requirement for the job, but more as a means to have more skills in search for a job in research fields and for an application for a Masters. I have some programming background, so, they seem easy, so far. Have you got any other recommendations?

It feels overwhelming and like it is 'too late', but it's the best and most interesting fit for a hopefully better future where I can finally work from home. I am looking for a suitable laptop. It will be Windows based because I have already so many things to learn, I don't have time to do ""work-arounds"" on MacOS. I just wonder if I really need GPU?

634,"That's the point, after 10 years of using windows I started to find it annoying... I tried a Mac computer that a friend just bought and half a year later I bought my first Mac.

At first, I found it annoying and use the laboratory computer to make the graphics, and a few data analyses... but now, fifteen-year later, I don't like to use windows(*), I don't have any problems with Linux. So If there is any software for one application, I don't buy it and move to another that runs on macOS, also I could use Python or R to study the data analyses.
(*) All my Apple computers have a lifespan of 6 to 7 years and are sold to another person.

700,"Great video analysis; thanks! But I would add a couple of points. As for M1 machines: the extra money for the 13"" Pro over the Air can be justified by: extra screen brightness and extra battery life. Just something to think about. As for the 14"" machine: same things: bigger battery and FABULOUS (and meaningfully larger) screen. If you work on battery and your eyes can get tired, then the screen and battery capacity can matter a lot. I also expect support for Metal and the M1 GPUs in general will increase dramatically. There will likely be a dramatic gain in the relative performance of the big GPUs in the Pro and Mac chips. I expect also better support for VMs in general.

I'm 47-year old master of mechanical engineering, with 18-year engineering career, and I'm pretty passionate about data analytics, data science, as well as machine learning. I'm about to switch career, and I completed entire Google Analytics Professional Certificate over the 4-month period from July to November 2021, this year. My impressions are that the course is worth of attending, and considering that I'm not 100% beginner the first three were not very useful for me, as well as spreadsheets taking into account that I'm quite experience Excel user but SQL, R-language and the capstone project were excellent. Also a minus about this entire course is I would like to see more practicing, an instructor to lead the students through entire process of data analysis by using at least couple of practical examples!

996,"üëè This is an awesome video on the different ""Data Science"" roles. (Though I've never played Mario and got lost when it focusing on one role, showing only one title at a time, and comparing to the others. ME: ""WAIT! Was Luigi the 'engineer' or the 'analyst'?"")





I will say that, towards the end, it gets a bit discouraging. And perhaps it begins with the interviewees. Lots of vloggers and guests appear to be fresh out of college with multiple degrees, including masters, or took one sponsored advertiser's certificate course and landed six-figure FAANG jobs in a matter of weeks with little or, in the case of one, no effort to even submit a resume.





This doesn't seem realistic and gives the impression, much like many job postings, that anyone without a masters and decades of experience in technical skills like Python or PBI AND Tableau, etc is not ""qualified"" for even a basic ""Data Science"" role.

I never faced this issue with our previous Tableau/Redshift stack. The volume of data we're dealing with isn't gargantuan.

It can cause you to miss out on great jobs that you could be qualified for based on your past experience. The data analyst skillset is very transferable, so it is important to keep an open mind while you job hunt. I was able to combine my previous customer support experience with the skills I acquired from this course to land a community research manager position. It took me about a month to get my official offer, but this course opened up a whole new career path that I didn't even know was available to me. Once I'm more settled in my new job, I plan on taking the Google Project Management course next so that I can meet the requirements for the CAPM exam. As far as the job search resources, I found that networking in real life did way more for me than anything they provided.

1410,"Thanks Luke. I breezed through the first 3 courses in this certificate and felt super confident I could nail this in a couple of months time. I must admit it got super hard from course 4 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development. The learning curve is exponential. Each of those 7-15 min videos took me 4-5 hours to complete with contact pauses-plays. The Python in this course is definitely not for beginners. I completed the 4th course just for the sake of it but I don't believe I have mastered any of the skills.

1415,"Hi Luke! Love the channel. I know this is a bit past the mark for this video, but wanted to throw my two cents in. I became a data analyst first, and am now in the process of rounding out the certs, degree, and general experience to build upon this career path I discovered and love! I am currently running through the Google Data Analytic certificate, and I agree a lot of the focus is ground level up, and some overlap on the basics that I already know. Having said that, it fills in a few knowledge gaps and makes that foundation even stronger. If someone in my situation has the time and ability to afford and take a cert like this, it gives a generally understood signal to employers or recruiters that those foundational ideas  (spreadsheets, basic data analytics and project management concepts) are a known skill. There are far worse ""unnecessary"" certs to have, especially considering the overall quality and name recognition of a Google cert.",UgxfAl347DVkKiopTrJ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-hFSYBzcysq0gVe5IwSLsA,Jonathan Novak,1,8,2021-09-27 15:43:52+00:00,BEKXRqqgHCw,1,Get a JOB w/ Google Data Analytics Certificate?!?

Personally, there are a couple of points that I'd like to mention that I strongly believe are worthy, in order to have a healthy discussion. I use Spark, Python and SQL almost every day on my job, like each language to me has its own pros and cons. I used to work as a DBA, so I have a couple of second thoughts regarding SQL haha. I do agree that Excel, R and SQL are good foundational languages to start in this field, and I'm not a Python fan, or better said, I'm not advocating for any language, to me, the tool, or language of choice, will depend on the needs of your project, and the community you have. Like, why would you use SQL or Python or R or any language, when you can actually combine them. My advice, would be, don't marry any language or tool, because that's all what they are: TOOLS.",UgyAv9v5xIkBI2EHz0V4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXug4zQAy6hCwT7rcNDQhw,Hugo Estrada,1,6,2021-09-23 21:19:52+00:00,Zcy-ND_4ydQ,1,Learn PYTHON to be a DATA ANALYST?!?

I am currently taking 3 courses 2 hrs a day 2 days a week for 10 weeks. Data Analysis with R & RStudio, Data Analysis with Python Anaconda and Python basic Machine learning. That's how I came across with your channel. 4 months ago I took a 60 hrs course in Python 3 which was based in the Cisco PCPA. These courses are free in my city because of a Microsoft techspark project they did with the Mexican government. My dream is to get an Entry level job in Data science I just have my High School Degree but if I get a job with the salary they have for entry level positions in my city I will be able to pay my college right now I have 2 daughters and my wife is pregnant and making 100dlls a week!

SQL really is the foundational skill you need before Python or R. Writing proper, and specific queries will save you so much time and effort. Whether the data is local, or in a cloud based service, you need to know SQL to even interact with it. You will never analyze the data if you cant write sql to retrieve it. 

That being said, I still think Python is easier for beginners vs R because the syntax is considerably easier. Python is generally written in plain english whereas R has a lot of funky syntax.

1880,"I haven't played with Power BI, but I know for sure that Tableau is nothing more than a toy.
User experience is zero.

Why is it impossible to change the scale with the mouse, as in the whole modern world? Why it should be so difficult for me: to select the data, and then go into the popup, which disappears and bugs every other time. 

Why does the ""+"" button increase vertically, and does not scale horizontally? What is this anyway?)) Nobody has been doing this for 7 years

Yet again. Tableau has a powerful aggregation computation engine. Let's imagine I have multidimensional data. Suppose I want to play with the order of dimensions, and immediately change the aggregation function for each column on a fly, in view mode? These are almost the most basic things with multidimensional data. The Tableau forums community has topics where people need it, but as a solution, it is proposed to create an N number of shits and a combo box with the desired column orders. Are you serious? So for these basic operations, I must create a dashboard, ton of sheets, a huge number of calculated fields,  which will be multiplied by two if I want to change the aggregation function for each field, write a ton of text, that must be updated if the count of dimension will change. Instead of just use Drag-n-drop to change the column order and switch aggregation function in the headers? 

Okay, lets imagine I use parameters to select the order of the dimensions. Let's say I have some columns of dimensions and one for date. And I want to, on the fly, in view mode, look at the date on a first position, and then change the order and make the date last. To see the final series as a time series. This could be done with a single movement of the mouse by dragging the date column to the end of the table. But in fact, the scoreboard cannot do anything about it at all. Because you cannot write a CASE statement for calculated fields, because the columns have different data types .... So we have to stay with the dashboard and showing hiding a big number of sheets. Very fan.

I don't even want to think about the case when I want to drag-and-drop to create a new group inside the table by simply dragging and dropping one column onto another in view mode. 

Usability at zero. Tableau is good for showing a static report, with few customizations, in a completely non-user-friendly manner. I believe he does not need such a strong data processing engine that he has. He still can't use it 100%",UgzwLvzHRFousuSq1wx4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFGKE8E0EFPlYR7WdyvNhRQ,Somatic Human,1,0,2021-08-25 13:19:49+00:00,axgNfM55dw8,1,Power BI vs Tableau - Best BI Tool,2021-08-25

Data Analysis process theory - strong
Instructors enthusiasm and engagement - strong
Technical coverage of SQL, Tableau, R - average/mediocre
150 employer job consortium - poor

If you are completely new to data analysis this course may be  good fit since it really presents the steps in the data analysis process thoroughly.

If you already have some exposure to SQL, Tableau, Python/R  this course  likely won't teach you anything new technically.

If you are drawn by the 150 employer job consortium in the U.S. then I would not recommend since Google has fallen short here since the job resources they provide to certificate holders contain very few entry level data analyst jobs.",UgxSbwCm6668PTQC5F54AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9FP9dSzlrjdjwiZQ49VSA,Shiva Suresh,1,0,2021-08-23 20:26:43+00:00,BEKXRqqgHCw,1,Get a JOB w/ Google Data Analytics Certificate?!?

Regarding the recommended Python course, so here's my situation: 
I am considering signing up for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate but I'm aware that it uses R language instead of Python. Now that being said I did take an introductory level 3-credit Python course in the spring semester back in college last year (we even had to do a program to design an obstacle free-path using Matplotlib and Numpy things like that). So that's my background with Python.

Last year I pushed Google Sheets to the limit by creating an extremely complex sheet that parsed a 90 thousand line XML file, into cells so I could cross reference that data with my database (in a different tab of course) that would display it to the user where they would use it to do more functions. It worked, but it was slow.
I‚Äôm glad I did it because I had to learn a little JavaScript to accomplish what I needed to do. That branched off to me learning Python and creating the same project into a website version that I could easily expand using a template that would dynamically change.
Now, I am in the process of creating a standalone windows application that does the same functionality, much faster, and much more stable.

Especially for making more advanced visualization such as making pareto chart, Tableau is easier than Power BI.

Tableau is easier to use specifically to make more advanced and good looking  dashboard while power BI must do more complex programming using M-Code which is hard to use.

I believe what these courses is very similar conceptually. Starting Module 5 I am starting to work more on the technical assignments diving into SQL. As I find myself in the gruesome job hunt like many are after college and having multiple interviews. I do not know if this will be enough experience to land any kind of job. I relate this professional certificate closely to my applied computing minor.

2417,"Hey Luke.

I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been up and down with my life.
I did computer science, dropped out after a year to pursue a degree in business. Dropped out of that after 2 and a half years because I no longer had the funds required to continue. And now I‚Äôm back again doing computer science but I flunked the year.
I just felt so overwhelmed, with childhood trauma creeping up, a failed relationship and overwhelming thoughts of just being a wasteful drag to society, it was hard to stay focused. 
I‚Äôm in this limbo of making too many excuses and not forgiving myself.

If I stayed in computer science when I started, I would not only have finished my degree but could have been pursuing a MSc in data science by now (my new dream).
I‚Äôm 23. I literally failed being a first year again.

All this stuff is ‚Ä¶ overwhelming, but god do I love it all. I just feel way to stupid and way to late.

Do you think its worth it for me to pursue this career (from the sounds of it) ? 
By the time I finish graduating (if they aren‚Äôt any more set backs) I‚Äôll be 29-30, is that not too late or am I already putting roadblocks in my mind that don‚Äôt exist.

The fact that I can‚Äôt pass first year computer science (for the second time) doesn‚Äôt give me hope that I‚Äôd be remotely cut out for these hard hitting projects.

I don‚Äôt consider myself a loser but‚Ä¶ I feel like losing. I‚Äôm just kind of exhausted to continue living in a perpetual cycle of nothingness.
Or should I fight through it all ? Once more, just‚Ä¶ PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH.

I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ (of course I‚Äôm not expecting you to tell me what to do with my life, but some advice would be warranted. For the time being, I‚Äôm looking for a job so I don‚Äôt feel like a total useless piece of garbage. So that I can start once more next year, and do it part time)",UgxcR_hSEXwmAVAaFpp4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBkDKl02Izs2mwjZSsGoGw,The Rodestarr,5,1,2021-07-14 12:37:10+00:00,ZWqH5emDdOI,5,Staying Motivated in Data Science,2021-07-14

2442,"For small businesses.

I dont understand why csv and tsv files are not encouraged more. It took me 10 minutes to train my friend into how to open and edit a tsv file properly in their favorite spreadsheet program. 

The best thing to do is teach some basic sql and add it in as a plugin to the spreadsheet program. 

The biggest difference between an enduser and a software developer is that the enduser expects their program to work even if they put in ambigious data. A developer knows that exactness is required. 

Once I got my friend trained on the concept of yes the program will react differently if you put an uppercase vs a lowercase letter as a filename and special symbols may or may not affect the output, they were able to troubleshoot their own issues. 

My favorite software is things like xidel. It's a commandline based sql query engine that can process all manners of tsv,csv,txt,sql files. Especially large ones. 

Also regular users like visual dashboards, they are way easier to learn how to make in microsoft excel than asking to them say use html/css.

2512,"Hey Luke,

Being a data analyst for last 1.5 years, here are my thought on the video:
- Pretty well made video, keeps people interested to what is coming next.
- *R vs Python* : Agree, they should have chosen Python or provided an option to switch.
- *Excel is less important* : Strongly disagree, I use Excel as much as SAS on a daily basis or more.
- *Certification is useful for getting the Job* : No, but I would like it to add it in my resume.",UgxpCQkgkRarbOXTrjB4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqIg3dHPaHU3QFiFImcmRTg,Pradeep Singh,3,17,2021-07-08 10:08:01+00:00,BEKXRqqgHCw,3,Get a JOB w/ Google Data Analytics Certificate?!?

2578,"Good case example. We use Tableau to mine our various data lakes for analytics and is mostly for the non technical people/managers. We started to use MSs BI solution but that is more the technical side of the house that uses it more for machine learning and custom mining data for patterns that indicate unknown opportunities for sales or network operations trends/audits that cause system outages in the future.

Python is a great companion for Excel as well as data on a SQL database as that server can run python on it instead of the end users machine and just send them results in a browser or Tableau plugin. R is getting traction in data science because its faster in the runtime but is still going through growing pains where Python is very well known and proven. Both are great for this type of work though. It's all about using the right tool for the right job.

SQL is great for tabular data but has its own limitations. If your data is multiple tables of related/join data and needs to find various relationship based insights that change it has the same problem as Excel. The larger and more numerous the data tables are it gets slower to search. The queries of those tables also gets slower the more intricate the relationships of the data gets. It can get to a point the SQL engine dies and crashes the server as the memory gets full while it compiles the query results in RAM before sending the final results to the user. If you need to find unknown insights of data based on its relationship its better to migrate the data to a graph database engine like Neo4j.",UgzkBXS5eHTxIyXneml4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpLKw8jhbMrkXJLepuJ7h8w,eltreum1,1,0,2021-07-02 21:53:41+00:00,3TBwY4VjLX8,1,STOP using Spreadsheets for Everything!,2021-07-02

More seriously, I guess this can be a decent base for an analyst, if you have experience you can find a job with no or few academic qualifications, though an analyst summurizes data and then does presentations on it, in my experience; so if you want to do it, more power to you, just make sure you're not getting the wrong idea.

If you like the implementation and/or system architecture (databases, implementation, parallelization, decentrallization,etc), you should still go study CS.

If you like develloping new models to solve new issues, manage the risk of the model, boost performance, etc, you should study math and statistics, maybe with extra focus on the algorithmic side.",Ugxcs-LZxQtyDqhMur54AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_ssjbmX5HMUUPJ5o2-Jdg,Alex Rey,1,0,2021-07-02 20:01:53+00:00,BEKXRqqgHCw,1,Get a JOB w/ Google Data Analytics Certificate?!?

2587,"Great follow up video after posting your initial video on the certificate. I think the expectation by many was that this certificate would instantly land them a job, or it would be as if Google would have facilitated their consortium of companies to reach out to every course completer, which is not the case. Overall, it was a very clean presentation of material which other providers have delivered in a very mundane way but it wasn't about job placement and in my opinion, I think that the majority of people that have completed the program won't mind that. However, some may have thought otherwise. I say take this program with a grain of salt as I had and think of it as a simple grouping of some data analysis concepts. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether they taught in R vs. Python. Go out now and learn how to clean, process, analyze, and visualize in Python if you like. Build a portfolio. Update your resume.

2591,"Just completed the course 2 weeks ago, I did the course with the video at 1.25 speed as someone suggested, cause it's very slow at times, Like everyone has pointed out the beginning 3 modules of the course is kinda meh, it could have optional or at the end. 

cons:
1. This certificate alone won't help you land a job, it doesn't get you prepared for the on-job scenarios, cause it is very theory intensive at times
2. Could have focused more on practical uses and more exercises or challenges using your skills throughout

pros:
1. It's worth doing it and getting a start in the data field

suggestion: Would be if the course started as you being hired as a data analyst at Google and you get tasks and more on the job scenario of what a data analyst would do, learn as you go and solve the tasks kinda way, they had a few exercises like that, but, maybe the whole course should be insightful and learning and more doing experience of an actual data analyst at Google. and how they did the same tasks/exercises and their thought process, rather than people from google just endlessly taking.

2597,"Begin projects as early as possible as you learn Python. Basic simple projects as a way to stay motivated. If you goal is data analytics or data science or machine learning,  begin with automating the retrieval of static data and later the retieval of data that updates over time, preferably daily or weekly but monthly will suffice - lottery draw data or weather data for your community are good candidates. Next, find a small ready-made dataset which contains missing values and other anomalies to practise cleaning the data as well as very introductory exploratory data analysis - stick to descriptive statistics at this point, no need to plot the data yet if you look into correlation, skew and kerosis along with standard desriptive statistics instead, focus on learning various distributions and how data distribution can affect statistical measures and possibly how to overome these problems. When practising automated data retrieval do not limit yourself to the equivalent of downloading a file...explore retrieving data via an application programming interface (API) of which there are a variety, learn how to only retrieve new data when a dataset has changed; a dataset might be a webpage that you want to scrape (check whether scraping is allowed), therefore, you should learn how to avoid retrieving previously obtained data. The three stages (data retrieval, data cleaning, and initial exploratory data analysis) should keep you busy for a few weeks, allowing you to hone newly-acquired skills while you continue learning Python in preparation  for other stages of the process.

A lot of school in europe that teaches data-analysis also uses online platforms that teaches students then gives them chance to do internships, so the differences within 2 year program or 3 year programs are not greatly different but ofc, you have to really put efforts in making a good portfolio to showcase your skills.

2644,"Thank you Luke. 
I finished this course and Excel is heavily focused (Google Sheet). It 's very little to analysis itself which should be a star of the show.
The course is focus on soft skills,¬†presentation skill, knowing the tasks and tools available as data analyst.
This course does not provide much of technical skills in depth on using tools for analysis. 
Is it a good course? It's one of a kind in terms of introducing you to the world of Data Analyst in a broad picture. 
On positive note, I learned and understand what is data analyst, the scope of the job, what should you expected to deliver, what technical skills you need. 
I am satisfied about 80%.. There is some part that go beyond my expectation; Data Visualization , course resources. But there are parts that I am quite disappointed; Analysis(If you already took the course, you will understand),  Data Manipulations , SQL, Tableau, very few practical useful labs. 
Conclusion:
If I would had to choose again, would I take this course ?  Yes, I would.
Is this course suitable for everyone who interested in Data field with zero knowledge? Yes, it is.",Ugx-JdN9UYa5TozKJbN4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM3iNaCOlDDYO6HbPOCf20g,Minna Mi,7,11,2021-07-01 05:03:11+00:00,BEKXRqqgHCw,7,Get a JOB w/ Google Data Analytics Certificate?!?

I have come to conclusions that I'll be using Coursera as my main source of education and certificates.

2993,"excel is a great tool, but it must be handled with care. Users love excel spreadsheets because it's easy to use and they can easily integrate spreadsheets into therir daily workflow. If some care is taken, you can use excel without great trouble. Some things I learned (the hard way) along many years are: 1) Don't store data in spreadsheets (BIG NO). Store data in a SQL Database and use that data from the spreadsheet by using the tools provided by excel to connect to databases. 2) Don't use the query builder provided with excel, instead, put your query into a stored procedure and just call that sp from excel. SP's are way more tractable, a DBA can get lots of usage statistics about sp's and if some changes are made in the undarlying structure of the database, you only need to modify that SP instead of changing every single excel file. 3) This is a bit difficult one, but the rewards are huge. Spreadsheets tend to ""spread"", and if no care is taken, that spread can become a realy nightmare. At some time, we had over 50.000 spreadsheets in the company (we made a ""bot"" for counting them). We are not interested in traking every single excel file, we are interested in tracking only thoose that connect to the company database. Normaly, an averange user can't make such a spreadsheet by himself, the will need some help from the IT deptartment, but once the file is created, nobody will stop him from making lot of copies and modifications, and there is where de hell begins. A way we found for mitigating this is, for every excel file usign db connections: a) register the file: assign an UUID for that file a and put it into the spreadsheet's VBA code. Every time a copy of de file is made, that UUID is inherited, so we can know where a spreadsheet came from, no matter the name of the copy. b) change the code of de event ""Workbook_Open"", so every time the file is open, that UUID is sent to a service along the name and location of the spreadsheet. We use that service to log excel ussage statistics, and the service response to verify if the spreadsheet is a valid or a deprecated one.",UgwitJDJG-IClI0mrQZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPxpT7QD36vGqDeXfjZSmAQ,Carlos Esquivel,1,2,2021-06-12 08:57:38+00:00,3TBwY4VjLX8,1,STOP using Spreadsheets for Everything!,2021-06-12

3011,This video speaks to me on so many levels. I had a job where they told me I needed to make a master table thank linked EDI trading partners and account #'s to the master account #. The problem is that it requiring pulling annual data so that I could pivot it out and that annual data had 500k to over a million rows of data and there was multiple instances of those that I had to vlookup into the master. It would take minutes to load those excel sheets and if I so much as did a find and replace on a file it would crash it instantly. I kept insisting that they needed to give us access to SQL and the databases but because nobody understood how scripting can make those processed much more efficient they just told me to keep trying. Excel isn't meant to be a replacement for database queries or scripting but companies are stuck in the past and think it can do everything until they try it themselves and realize how impractical it is.,UgyGmpOii593q1YUkWJ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRTU9qUY0MbEAVyA2RO0m5A,Ryan Pennington,1,2,2021-06-10 03:57:26+00:00,3TBwY4VjLX8,1,STOP using Spreadsheets for Everything!,2021-06-10

3016,"Hello Luke,

I recently started out on learning data analytics and I'm simultaneously charting my learning process going forward. My aim is to set up a remote work environment as a freelancer. Data visualization is where I'm stuck right now. Most of everything that I'm learning uses software that is almost entirely free or open source. I can't seem to find a way to go around the payment barrier entirely, which is totally fine since I feel either of these softwares will prove to be worth the money. 

My main concern is regarding their subscription model. As you mentioned Power BI has the Pro and Premium with pro account only allowing sharing with other pro users and unrestricted sort of sharing capability for Premium. But how does the creator subscription work exactly for tableau? Is it like the adobe creative cloud subscription wherein you can do multiple commercial projects for different clients with that account , implying that the creator¬†can create different dashboards for different clients using a single creator subscription and making it available for the client using multiple instances of Tableau online or server via maybe explorer accounts? ¬†

Or is it like the creator account can actively make and host only one dashboard for one particular client and another project would mean another tableau creator license?",Ugza8ldlaeeLkpnZYaV4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCou8gcOnUy1FfxBRdC7lMMw,Arjun Haridaas,4,1,2021-06-09 09:16:58+00:00,axgNfM55dw8,4,Power BI vs Tableau - Best BI Tool,2021-06-09

3118,You've described two roles one is a insight analyst and the other an MI BI Analyst. One does reporting excel and makes slides. The other is BI building dashboard  using something like SSRS or Power BI for dashboards. The issues arise when teams build in house dashboards using insight analysts that generally use Excel. The reason excel and these dashboard won't go away is because of cost. It's cheaper to make an excel tool to do the day to day than to build a whole CRM system. It's easier for analysts to use Excel because management use Excel it has a lower entry bar and analysts that know excel are cheaper. If management knew Jupiter notebook or python then the bar would be higher... It would be great if business would use the right tool for the job but they don't because of cost and available knowledge...,Ugx2aG7mXX8628gFCdF4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoJ6zbF_S5V7n6q4G6TK0g,connozac,1,1,2021-05-31 22:31:26+00:00,3TBwY4VjLX8,1,STOP using Spreadsheets for Everything!,2021-05-31

3198,"Hi, Good review!

*Disclaimer - I work for Pyramid Analytics*

There are ""popular"" analytic tools and then those that are more functionally complete: server based with zero footprint install on client machines (pure HTML5 UI); more scalable; more suited to large scale deployment; have good governance on data and content; do not require data download and ingestion to a proprietary in memory data engine; centrally managed, reusable, versioned components; highly visual data preparation with built  in Machine Learning; Collaboration, Annotation, user subscriptions, user alerts; paginated report distribution etc. etc. Pyramid Analytics falls into this category.

There are regular assessments of the analytics platform market from independent industry analysts you can also check out, for example Dresner, BARC and Gartner. All three of those rank Pyramid in top place in terms of its capability, outperforming Power BI and Tableau.


It is highly likely tht the best fit analytic platform for your organisations is not the populist choice. Have a good look around the Analytics and BI market, there are some astonishingly good products outside these two.

3296,"I've not used Tableau, but for Power BI, I think it is especially better for those who have experience with Power Query, database relationship management and Pivot Charts, since basically Power BI runs on these 3 concepts mainly. 

For me, Power BI basically a more advanced Pivot Chart which can link multiple tables together through relationships, something you can't do in Excel, since Excel's Pivot Charts require a single Pivot Table to work with. Also, the cross-filter options and drilldown, drillthrough, bookmark etc. features are great improvements over Pivot Charts.

Edit on 18/6/21: I've learnt Tableau, and here are my thoughts on Tableau vs Power BI:
1) Tableau is better in some areas, such as the customisation of charts, like using of the colors and tooltips cards to show more details, which is definitely an edge over Power BI. It also comes with more features such as the page pane and stories function, which Power BI does not have. In fact, Tableau uses a more tiered way of worksheet -> dashboard -> story, while Power BI only has dashboard. However, all of the charts in Tableau are interconnected so it might be a good idea to make all of them the same size, or else a change in a dashboard can mess up your chart in the worksheet, for example.

2) Tableau's style of organising its data pane is more aesthetically pleasing and intuitive than Power BI, since it organises table columns into dimensions and measures, and color codes them, you can even switch a measure into dimension and vice-versa for different purposes. Generally I find that this makes Tableau easier to use, especially for people who have not used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts previously.

3) Power BI is better in more areas than I imagined, however. For a first, I can't really figure out how to explore and clean data effectively in Tableau, whereas Power BI is integrated with Power Query, an excellent tool for handling small to mid-sized databases. It also makes exploring and cleaning data easy. And for the data modelling, Power BI follows SQL's style of listing by table names and columns, while Tableau only lists the table names. So yea, I feel that Power BI is much better in fine-tuning the data before data visualisation, while for Tableau it's a good idea to do the fine-tuning somewhere else first, not that you can't, but it's harder to and less useful imo. But Tableau has data blending, though that has its own caveats as well.

4) I find Power BI easier to use while I'm creating my first visualization, and here's why. Power BI has cross-filtration and chart syncing automatically activated, while Tableau's default is that they are not activated, and you need to activate them chart by chart, which is tedious. In fact, an issue I had with Excel dashboards is the non-automatic syncing of slicers (filters). Also, I can't find a way to clear all applied filters using one button in Tableau, while in Power BI I used a workaround involving Bookmarks (not in Tableau). So sometimes I'm not sure if I have accidentally activated multiple filters when I only want one activated. And also, the parameters don't seem to have a ""return to default"" function.

5) Speaking of filters in Tableau, it is a nightmare to distinguish between the different types, which are filters, sets, highlighters and parameters, since they have different functions and options. And not differentiated that well in the filter pane. But of course, they add to the customizability in Tableau as well, whereas in Power BI I recall a filter is a filter with different functions that you can play with. For example, Tableau's set + parameter can give you Top N, something Power BI's Top N function can achieve. Of course, the customizability is different. 

6) One huge difference between the 2 is that Power BI offers nearly the full package for free (other than publishing it online and using its store, from what I know), while Tableau Public (its free version) requires all datasets and visualizations to only be available online. So here's the main difference: for free versions, Power BI only offers offline use, while Tableau only offers online use. The problem though, is that if you are handling confidential or sensitive info, you would definitely not want to use Tableau Public since everything, especially the datasets, would be exposed to... the public.

In conclusion, Tableau is better for very customizable visualizations, while Power BI is a more complete package that needs more expertise to make good visualizations. If you are using free versions only for sensitive information, Power BI is your only feasible solution.",Ugzk8s6ZDl8UKFma1Wl4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOcedZ9uaaJd8Ct5G96Gh9g,Ho Homer,1,4,2021-05-19 16:58:11+00:00,axgNfM55dw8,1,Power BI vs Tableau - Best BI Tool,2021-05-19

3321,"Both are pretty similar, in terms of calculated fields, i found Tableau to be simpler than DAX used in PowerBI.
PowerBI is a lot more straightforward to get started with, Tableau takes around 2 weeks to self-learn.

Both are entirely unsuitable for large datasets, once the row count goes over 2 billion(around 2gb workbook size), even with extracts it can take up to a few minutes to load a view.

3326,"This is not a good review of the two products. - to summarise - PowerBI is cheaper, easier to use and better integrated into the already existing eco system (who is not integrated into MS Ecosystem?). Tableau is more expensive, less intuitive and 3rd party. also having data 'ready' before using in the application is just good BI practise. and I think you'll find PBI will also respond better to clearer already structured datasets... - having been a user of both products for the past 6 years - I much prefer PowerBI.

3478,"Beloved, Please give this your special attention. 

God is a Good, Holy and Just( meaning that He up holds justice and does what He deems as good) Judge. He is also forgiving and He is All-Loving. He is also perfect meaning that there is nothing about Him this is  contradictory. But How can He forgive you and me but still uphold Justice. 

Look at it in this way:  Judges who punish the innocent and release the wicked  and quilty, are wicked, evil and are corrupt. It does not matter how much a quilty man is sorry for his crime, he must go to jail. Let's say a man raped and murdered a little girl, but is so sorry for the rape; the judge must still send him to jail. And likewise God must still punish our sins, but He can still forgive us. How? How can God forgive us and still satisfy His Justice? 

This is how:  

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no not one‚Äù (Romans 3:10, 23 NKJV).
-It means that each and every single person sins and has sinned. 

‚ÄúThe wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord‚Äù (Romans 6:23).
-Death is eternal separation from God in hell.
- But believing in Christ alone allows you to be with God in everlasting joy. 
 
‚Ä¢""The iniquity and sins of each and every persons were placed upon Jesus Christ who was sinless. 

‚Ä¢Jesus Christ, the Son of God was crucified for our sins. 

 ‚Ä¢Jesus Christ was buried and our sins were buried with Him to live no more.

‚Ä¢Jesus Christ arose from the dead on the third day and all who believe and receive Him as Lord arose to new life with Him.

‚Ä¢ New life in Jesus Christ is received through faith in His death burial and resurrection, when the person repents of their sin and asks Jesus Christ to forgive their sin and wash their heart.

Beloved seek Him, read the Bible, not the catholic Bible(deutero-canonical books)

Start by read the whole of the new testament, starting from Matthew to Revelation..

There was much much more you skipped over that has made Power Bi Gardner's #1 BI tool for the last 3 years.

As someone who also uses Tableau, Power Bi seems to have just about everything and more... 3 or 4 years ago was not the case at all. Power Bi seems to have more choice from the data model (using m query and dax) and the visualization standpoint which I prefer. If control is most important then Tableau will be the way to go...

I will be getting my name changed soon and I read that Coursera does ID verification only once and cannot update the information afterwards (name update can only be done if it was an Name verification). So do you know if I enroll for the Google Analytics course when am I required to do the verification? Can I do it just before the completion and when I want the certificate? Because by then my name change should be done. I don‚Äôt want to do the verification early on because that would result in the certificate and future certificates to all contain the previous name.",UgwSLfnHLN1GPtY1zaB4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1m58bm0VjGDnexjTEw8H9g,Aby,1,0,2021-05-03 22:22:33+00:00,jp-Lv_3a2VI,1,Google vs IBM Data Analyst Certificate - BEST Certificate for Data Analysts,2021-05-03

3547,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.

As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.

I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. 

When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.

My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.

None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.

The answer from all 12 was a flat and resounding ""NO!""   I did not contact google or coursera to ask them due to the fact that neither has a physical presence in my state.

4471,"My take on is this. There are exceptional people who can learn anything at a professional level. Computer science, engineering, math, architecture, you name it. These are the kind of people who can take these courses and be hired into a company a be a great asset for their team. However, there are other ""normal"" people who don't have that amazing intellect to learn everything. I am a software engineer, degree and all of that. I have 3 coworkers that took a certificate on the technology (crm tool) we  work with. They are math, history and law majors. They excel at working with the tool and delivering simple stories but whenever they encountered something related with service integration, code complexity, asynchronous problems or even simple SQL etc they require a lot of help. This sometimes causes other members to assign bandwidth to help them out there. College REALLY does train you to be a problem solver. IF you ever want to take a certification and work for a software company please make sure you don't become a liability to your team.

4541,"I ve been using Excel, quite good at it, did a bit of R(market segmentation and clustering, and I have a decent knowledge of stats) and studied SQL on my own( joins, views, triggers). With that being said, I'm quite disappointed in this course. 

First, SQL. They list a source of materials, which are free anyway, and therefore zero input from google. 
I also find it kind of unacceptable to start off SQL with a query, and not going first through the concepts of relations, keys or constraints. If I m given a list of free external sources(which are not enough, and aren't google materials, so they spent zero $ and zero time on them), what's the point of paying google? They spent so much time talking about how important data is, that I expected a similar approach with the rest of the topics. 
Second, tableau; same approach, zero guidance, zero input from google, just some free stuff I could have found myself. 
Hoping their assignments are worth the time and money. 

Not even sure the course is worth it, unless one is a pure beginner.

I loved the Google over the A+ stuff as there is so much more hands-on and more engaging material. I believe the Google IT would carry a lot more weight if the course had a proctored final exam. To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week. As for as time, they suggest 6 months, I did it in 10 weeks as I was taking my A+ material.

4679,"Windows for ARM has been available since 2012. The current version of Windows for ARM was released with the Surface Pro X in 2019. Many of your problems have nothing to do with Windows on ARM, but are a result of trying to run it on the M1 - which is an Apple and Parallels problem. So it is misleading to suggest Windows Arm is ""under development"" and misleading to people thinking that Windows support on the M1 is immanent.

I have a Surface Pro X running the pre-release developer version with x64 support and my biggest problem is the OS updates one a week. Most applications run smoothly and the only one's I've had problems with so far are those that don't have ARM drivers for the hardware. In other words, Windows ARM runs just fine.

1. Windows ARM licensing is only from the OEM (at the moment) so the only way to get a licensed version of Windows on ARM is for Apple to supply it.
2. The main problem is drivers on the hardware (Apple) or in the virtual Machine (Parallels). Microsoft has nothing to do with these drivers and does not supply or support them.
3. Under the current legal situation, you will only be able to run the (ongoing developer) pre-release version of Windows for ARM - which by definition is unstable and lacks complete support and may have features disabled. This will be the case even when Windows for ARM officially supports x64 applications.

Microsoft is committed to a fully operational ARM Version, but it has never even hinted at supporting the M1 or providing consumer licenses for ARM. Keep in mind the M1 is ARM, but it is modified by Apple and may not be compatible with what Microsoft is writing it's code for. Again, Apple or Parallels must supply the drivers for this - because Microsoft only licenses and supports large OEM ARM makers.

I think the M1 is a fantastic chip and what Apple is doing is the future direction of computing hardware, but Windows support on MacOS M1 is not by any means a certainty. If you only run MacOS applications, get the M1. If you need Windows, then I suggest keep your old hardware around for now.",UgzZHbUJRFA9t7gBH-R4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydOpRCvgeqwir7EFQJUvNQ,Andrew Logan,1,1,2021-03-08 21:28:43+00:00,hWs_q9NBBKM,1,Install your favorite Windows app on M1 Mac - ft.

4725,"Thank you for your in depth analysis.¬†


From my point of view here are some more info :
- PBI is an instance of SSAS Tabular mode (+ a visualisation layer), as such you can prep your data, create your data model and query it with DAX (or SQL or MDX, and although it has nothing to do with the fact that it's SSAS you can also use R and Python),
- As being SSAS you happen to benefit from the 10+years of perf optimisations, all your tables are columnar based, compressed and available in memory,
- you can create with PBI a DW following the best Kimball practices (Dimensions, fact table, bridge tables, relationships from 1 -> many, many -> 1, many -> many, be careful of the directions of the relationship though it has changed between two versions),
- with Dax you can create calculated tables, calculated columns and kpi's, they won't sit in memory but will use processing power each time you are drilling  into granularities,
- you said ""PBI on my Mac"", actually PBI is not available on Mac, only on Windows (We have opened a request many years ago, a lot of people asked for it but apparently it is not going to be implemented, so you run it under a Windows VM (here Windows 10).  --> Tableau is available with Mac,
- with PBI online when viewing a report the user is limited with the amount of available ram on his browser, as such Microsoft has limited to 10k rows the amount of rows any table can return when downloading the data behind a PBI analysis, that can become an issue if the user wants to check the data.


IMHO you can't create a DW with Tableau, and this is for me a no go, but sure is a great tool.

4778,"Windows on ARM works just fine and has been on ARM since 2012. The Surface Pro X has been running Windows 10 on 64 bit ARM for more than a year. Recent developer releases allow for x64 emulation and so far I have been impressed with the stability although performance is not great. As a light productivity machine, it is hard to beat the Surface Pro X.

Windows on M1 is the issue and there are two problems:

1. Apple does not license Windows on ARM, so currently there is no legal way to run Windows on the M1 except for the developer version - which by definition is not a stable version of Windows.

2. The biggest problems with Windows on ARM are device drivers - these have to be supplied by the hardware maker, i.e. Apple, or software vender in the case of virtual machines, e.g. Parallels. Since Windows on ARM works just fine on licensed hardware, the problem is Apple not Microsoft.

Ultimately Windows on the M1 is going to come down to the chances of:

A: Apple licensing Windows as an OEM. Hmmm. Not very likely. 

Sadly this may be Microsofts goal - to force Apple to buy a license of Windows for all M1 Macs. Microsoft has limited interest in selling hardware, it has great interest in selling Windows to corporations. Microsofts ""eco-system"" is corporate services and that means Office, OneDrive, Exchange and other corporate data services. Apple's mostly closed eco-system is not compatible with Corporate business requirements which demands different licensing strategies and longer software/hardware support than Apple is willing to give. There is a reason Windows 10 works just fine on 15 year old MacBooks. There is a reason the Surface connect still exists - backwards compatibility. You don't tell the US Government you no longer support the 1 million PC's they bought 5 years ago when they are paying millions for ongoing data services.

B: Windows providing consumer versions of Windows for ARM, and Apple supplying drivers. 

I am not as optimistic, at least in the near term. Microsoft has almost no motivation to change it's policies in the near term. Microsoft may change this policy once there is a viable market on the PC makers sides of things. Not only does Microsoft build it's own ARM based PC's, but Microsoft' interests are best served by having a large competitive PC market on the ARM side of things driving down prices and encouraging innovation. Apple likes a closed system where it can keep prices up. In addition, Apple has a long history of supplying degraded drivers for it's hardware which makes Windows ""look"" bad on Apple hardware. Specifically, Bluetooth audio, Graphics, and touch pad drivers supplied by Apple in Bootcamp have been historically sources of poor performance on Macbook running Windows. In short, Microsoft has little motivation, monetary or otherwise to help Apple out. In 1-2 years PC laptops with ARM based processors with comparable performance to the M1 will be on the market. At that point what will Microsoft do? ""Ya dance with the one that brung ya."" Microsoft is just as likely to shut Apple out of Windows on ARM so that Dell, HP, Lenovo and others can continue to dominate the business computing world - with Windows pre-installed - which is what serves Microsoft best.

I have no doubt the teams at Apple knew all this and went ahead with the switch to ARM anyway. That is because Apple is not a corporate services company, it is a consumer services company. So Apple has little motivation to actually have Windows work on their ARM machines. As long as people can use Web based services to access the office, that is good enough for Apple. So, Apple's goal is to turn the PC into the next iPhone, a ubiquitous consumer device. I doubt that is going to happen because for most people their laptop or PC has to server double duty as a personal device and something to do office work on. As soon as office work is required, that means some piece of software which requires actual Windows. I suspect Apple will be satisfied with it's continued 10-15% of the market as long as they are really tied into the Apple Eco-system of services. In any event, the next few years will be interesting and the prospect of another PowerPC type of thing happening is very real but this time in the software domain rather than the hardware domain.

4898,256 gb is a bit too low. you constantly have to watch out for large apps and downloads. I find this micromanaging of storage unproductive and not worth the savings if you use it for work. Just get the 500 gb option so you don't have to watch your internal storage like a hawk. Hanging a storage drive off your computer is fine if you keep your laptop on your desk all the time. just note there's only 2 ports so even less reason to permanently plug up one of the ports with a hanging storage drive. Just be prepared to be constantly stressed about storage if you get the 256gb one.,Ugz_LIn0THH7Uy9cLjB4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCszobxZqRe2TeqdONlD9_Bw,Jono,5,3,2021-01-19 13:47:25+00:00,xzR4L_XYW3g,5,M1 Macbook Air vs Pro (8 vs 16 GB) for Data Science,2021-01-19
